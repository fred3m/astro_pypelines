Astro_Pypelines: Pypelines for Astropyp
=======================================
The pypelines here are are the beginnings of my work to create an easy user interface to `Astropy`_
and its affiliated packages. For now I won't have much documentation or explanation for these
packages but in the near future (before the end of 2014) I plan to create good documentation and
some more examples.

For now I recommend checking out the pypelines_template directory, which includes a basic template
that can be used for making new pypelines.

By September there should also be a working photometry pypeline that I'm using working on now to
reduce my own data.

To use any of these pypelines `Astropyp`_ must be installed

Special Note
------------
I am currently in the process of recreating and renaming astropyp and astro_pypelines. I advise waiting until
this process is completed before installing either astropyp or astro_pypelines on your computer. Within the next month
or two these repositories will be updated to emphisize that what is now astropyp will be a much more generic server- 
side data analysis package and it will be easier to create and modify pypelines in a way that doesn't require
root access.

Sorry for this change, but hardly anyone is using this package yet so I figured this would be a good time to
make significant upgrades.
