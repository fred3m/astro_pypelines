Astro_Pypelines: Pypelines for Astropyp
=======================================
The pypelines here are are the beginnings of my work to create an easy user interface to `Astropy`_
and its affiliated packages. For now I won't have much documentation or explanation for these
packages but in the near future (before the end of 2014) I plan to create good documentation and
some more examples.

For now I recommend checking out the pypelines_template directory, which includes a basic template
that can be used for making new pypelines.

By September there should also be a working photometry pypeline that I'm using working on now to
reduce my own data.

To use any of these pypelines `Astropyp`_ must be installed
